### Compiling and running

This assignment was written and tested with Python 2.7.1. There is no
compilation required just run with the command:

`python hw1.pdf -N 1000 -k 20 -d 1 -c 50`

That last command would have simulated over 50 cycles, a system of size
1000, a neighborhood size of 20, and a 1-Dimensional distance calculation.

`python hw1.pdf --help`

The program would output all of the possible command-line flags.
